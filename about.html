<p>I am looking forward to getting to know your child, but first I would like to tell you a little about me.  This is my fourth year teaching at Greenville Elementary.  I also worked at this school previously as a teacher's aide and a substitute teacher.  My four children also attended Greenville.  I have been a member of the Greenville Familly for a long time!</p>
<p>My family lives on a small farm in Greenville.  My husband is a surveyor, but he would love to be a farmer!  We bale hay, raise cows and chickens.  We also have a donkey, goats, cats and a new puppy.  My children are very involved in $-H.  My oldest Carly is 20 and works at a nursing home in Corydon.  Payton attends the University of Louisville.  Nick is a junior at Floyd Central.</p>
<p>We had an extremely busy summer with 4-H. In July my family hosted a 4-H exchange student from Poland.  We loved having Agnieska be a part of our family.  It was very interesting to learn about her life in Poland.</p>
